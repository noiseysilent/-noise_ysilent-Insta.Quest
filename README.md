This repository now contains a minimal static portfolio scaffold inspired by https://patricknyakundi298.github.io/Patrick-Edward/.

Files added:

- `index.html` — main site
- `assets/style.css` — styles
- `assets/script.js` — small UI helper script

How to view locally:

1. From the repo root run a simple HTTP server (recommended):

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
# then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser
```

2. Or open `index.html` directly in a browser (some features may be limited).

Next steps I can do for you:

- Replace text and images with your real content
- Add project pages or a projects JSON to populate cards dynamically
- Configure GitHub Pages deployment (I can add instructions or create a GitHub Actions workflow)

Tell me which of the above you'd like next, or ask for specific styling/content changes.
